# Password Game

This is a fun project that I created while learning Python. It's a web based game to guess randomly generated passwords.

## Installation

To run this game you will need `python` and `pip` already installed. Also, you need to install web.py, and create an empty sqlite database.

```bash
$ pip install web.py
$ mkdir data
$ python bin/gamedb.py
$ python bin/app.py
```

After you've done this, your game should be running on localhost:8080.
